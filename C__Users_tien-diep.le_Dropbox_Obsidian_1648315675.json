What is a Zettelkasten for?\n\nA little more about each of those underlying purposes:\n\nRetain what you read: No more forgetting what a book was about the moment you finish reading it. The Zettelkasten method helps break reading down into a series of engaging rituals that repeatedly expose you to the most interesting things you've read – thus helping you retain what you read.\nRetrieve it quickly: No more fumbling through pages to try to find that passage you want to reference. With your digital Zettelkasten, you can copy and paste the exact quote in seconds – along with bibliographic information, if you choose to record it.\nKnow what to read next: Your Zettelkasten helps you follow your curiosity in a productive way. If you're looking for something to read, you can look in your Zettelkasten to see what sparks your interest. Whatever you choose, exploring that topic will drive your writing projects forward.\nDevelop your ideas: Instead of starting each writing project with a blank page, you already have written short passages you can stitch together to create an instant first draft.\nHave ideas: Because your Zettelkasten frees your mental energy from having to remember and retrieve things you read or wrote long ago, you have more mental energy available to think about new ideas. The act of organizing your notes is just enough a challenge to spark new ideas without burning yourself out.\n[1/8/2022 12:22 PM](calibre://view-book/_hex_-43616c69627265/205/EPUB?open_at=epubcfi%28/20/2/4%5B5N3C0-570ec551acdc4f1795686976be867c51%5D/2%5Bchapter-5%5D/4%5Bchapter-5-text%5D/6/1%3A0%29)\n\nLink to the model of memory and creative.

Clearly defining your future can help reduce the uncertainty in your life, and reduce the amount of negative emotion that you chronically experience, in consequence. This is good for your confidence and for your health. Having well-defined goals also increases your chances of experiencing positive emotion, as people experience most of their hope and joy and curiosity and engagement as a consequence of pursuing valued goals (and not, as people generally think, by attaining them).\n\nIt can also be very useful to deeply imagine the future you would like to avoid. You probably know people who have made very bad decisions, and who end up with a life that nobody would want. You also likely have weaknesses yourself. If you let those get out of control, then you might also end up with a miserable, painful life. Most people know how their life could go downhill if they let it.\n\nSpend some time, now, thinking about what your life would be like if you failed to define or pursue your goals, if you let your bad habits get out of control, and if you ended up miserable, resentful and bitter. Imagine your life three to five years down the road, if you failed to stay on the path you know you should be on. Use your imagination. Draw on your knowledge of the anxiety and pain you have experienced in the past, when you have betrayed yourself.\n\nThink about the people you know who have made bad decisions or remained indecisive, or who chronically deceive themselves or other people, or who let cynicism and anger dominate their lives. Where do you not want to be?\n\nDream while you write, and don't stop. Write at least until the 15 minutes have passed. Let yourself form a very clear picture of the undesirable future.\n\nAvoid the procastination by all cost, my time is running fast. I need to do something before it's too late.\nAvoid being isolated and then destroy myself.

By performing a series of mutagenesis experiments on the CAST-selected probe, they defined a consensus sequence T/A-G/A-C-A-G-A-A-T/G/C most strongly bound by ZNF217-F67\n\nFound TGCAGAAG in promoter in ROBO1 gene from http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Sequence?db=core;g=ENSG00000169855;r=3:78597239-79767998\n\nKrig et al\n![[Pasted image 20220211130902.png]]"}]},{"id":"623d8034-a0f3-4334-ab60-3f98ea1d2889","page-name":"2022-03-18","children":[{"id":"623d8034-bd3f-405f-a98f-33ca9315c0aa","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"09:10  Arrived at the lab"},{"id":"623d8034-cf1c-4247-a62f-b9f49cc00579","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-e643-463a-817c-5b4c3e989bd6","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"{{embed ((62333435-5201-4934-82a6-9fecbccc643a))}}"},{"id":"6234f044-3001-4dd8-99dd-2d0e0e36d979","properties":{},"format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-cb4e-4697-acdc-a49776a36c2e","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"**GDF15 promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis and colonization through osteoblastic CCL2 and RANKL activation**"}],"content":"DOING Prepare presentation for the journal club \nid:: 6234f044-3001-4dd8-99dd-2d0e0e36d979\nSCHEDULED: <2022-03-19 Sat>\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2022-03-20 Sun 14:20:49]\n:END:"},{"id":"623d8034-5060-474a-93b5-6974d89463b9","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-e445-4497-affd-645c21efdb3c","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"17:49  Pass revluc revluc znf p17 18"},{"id":"623d8034-3450-4a0a-808e-2134b7c18964","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"18:20  Pass 4a5p18 1c4 p17 2f1 p18"}],"content":"[[cell culture]]"},{"id":"623d8034-5fb8-4212-959e-0d671281a4bd","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-3ea8-42aa-83c5-0c2bc5b1af2b","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Cyrille talk about how the clininian manange the breast cancer metastasis to bone"}],"content":"[[Unit meeting]]"}],"content":"[[Work]]"},{"id":"623d8034-9887-47af-aa8e-f4df401d9806","properties":{"collapsed":true},"format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-f69a-4d49-bd18-1b6ed00faf3e","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"CODE(S) BARRES ERRONE(S),IDENTIFICATION DU PRODUIT SUR TICKET DE CAISSE IMPOSSIBLE,LA DATE DU TICKET DE CAISSE EST ABSENTE OU ILLISIBLE"}],"content":"TODO Apply again for the oral B because my request was refused\ncollapsed:: true"},{"id":"623d8034-9a7b-44ef-9108-c542ce2bc74f","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"DONE Pass the cells\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2022-03-18 Fri 13:50:40]--[2022-03-18 Fri 21:40:17] =>  07:49:37\n:END:"},{"id":"623d8034-2e3a-4eea-85c2-efa07f9ae931","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":""}]},{"id":"623dc3c2-c52a-40a5-b779-f9359836d5f3","page-name":"2022-03-25","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623dc3c2-3218-4c0d-b295-67f0505f0b2c","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"06:14 Wake up"},{"id":"623dc3c2-e92e-4d7a-afb3-5e654401697b","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":""},{"id":"623dc3c2-3c78-4060-b04d-7fb2af40e60f","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"14:29 I'm struggling with the idea of\nsaving or spending money"}]},{"id":"623d8034-408d-432c-9f6c-ab65f18a6e58","page-name":"2022-03-17","children":[{"id":"623d8034-fd93-499d-aba9-ad22e9b5bdc4","properties":{"collapsed":true},"format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-0e50-46de-b2f1-957c1ca51eea","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"07:47  I just wake up"},{"id":"623d8034-03ec-43db-99f8-6f87a60f764f","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"I had the best sleep in months with 2 hours and a half of deep sleep"},{"id":"623d8034-600f-4a91-9d82-b8119963115d","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"I listened to French for a few minutes before heading up to work and it feel great to wake up early in the morning and then do somework before work.

The mechanisms by which bone metastasis seeds develop in primary tumors and specifically colonize the bone remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) functions as a master transcription factor for reprogramming cancer cells into an osteomimetic phenotype by pleiotropic transactivation of the BMP4/SMAD1 signaling pathway and bone-related genes that are expressed at early stages of bone differentiation. The epithelial-to-osteomimicry transition regulated by FOXF2 confers a tendency on cancer cells to metastasize to bone which leads to osteolytic bone lesions. The BMP antagonist Noggin significantly inhibits FOXF2-driven osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer cells.

In the current study, we determined the effect of apigetrin on AGS gastric cancer cell. Apigetrin reduced cancer cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest by regulating cyclin B1, cdc25c and cdk1 protein expression in AGS cell. Apigetrin treatment caused apoptotic cell death in AGS cells, characterized by the accumulation of apoptosis portion, cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP). Apigetrin-treated cells increased the expression of extrinsic apoptosis pathway proteins and mRNA. However, intrinsic apoptosis pathway related proteins were not altered. In addition, AGS cells treated with apigetrin increased autophagic cell death, featured by the formation of autophagic vacuole and acidic vesicular organelles. Autophagy marker proteins, such as LC3B-II and beclin-1, were increased, and p62, an autophagy flux marker protein, was also increased by endoplasmic reticulum stress. Also, the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway proteins and its downstream targets in apigetrin-treated AGS cells was identified to be decreased. Taken together, these data suggest that apigetrin-treated AGS cells induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, extrinsic apoptosis and autophagic cell death through PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which can lead to the inhibition of gastric cancer development. Thus, our findings strongly indicate that apigetrin is a basic natural derived compound that could be used as a nutrient source with potential anticancer activities against gastric cancer."}],"content":"[[Abstract]]"},{"id":"623d8034-ec92-4b92-b0f0-a32d0f1daab4","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-77df-4915-9f8d-a8c3dbc96766","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"![Kim et al_2020_Apigetrin induces extrinsic apoptosis, autophagy and G2-M phase cell cycle.pdf](../assets/Kim_et_al_2020_Apigetrin_induces_extrinsic_apoptosis,_autophagy_and_G2-M_phase_cell_cycle_1647384312359_0.pdf)"}],"content":"[[Attachments]]"},{"id":"623d8034-37ef-4cc8-b041-596ea9b4c430","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"((62311709-4450-4726-83df-c21762dc9fda))"}]},{"id":"623d8033-1b21-4219-80b2-7095645f2c6b","page-name":"Teaching English","properties":{"public":"trPrinciples:"},"children":[{"id":"623f494e-e4a0-4810-9975-2d598406ff17","properties":{},"format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8033-cd0e-4fb9-9e2b-f653f84dc5c5","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8033-d11a-4dc0-9b14-d5fdc7d52a40","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Questions that ask student to have 85% correct answers."}],"content":"Design a program that apply [[The 85 % Rule for Optimal Learning]]"},{"id":"623d8033-b80c-4186-b5e0-1a7b766fb9b9","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"After 90 minutes of learning, should we have something like meditation to impove learning.

The mechanisms by which bone metastasis seeds develop in primary tumors and specifically colonize the bone remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that forkhead box F2 (FOXF2) functions as a master transcription factor for reprogramming cancer cells into an osteomimetic phenotype by pleiotropic transactivation of the BMP4/SMAD1 signaling pathway and bone-related genes that are expressed at early stages of bone differentiation. The epithelial-to-osteomimicry transition regulated by FOXF2 confers a tendency on cancer cells to metastasize to bone which leads to osteolytic bone lesions. The BMP antagonist Noggin significantly inhibits FOXF2-driven osteolytic bone metastasis of breast cancer cells. Thus, targeting the FOXF2-BMP/SMAD axis might be a promising therapeutic strategy to manage bone metastasis. The role of FOXF2 in transactivating bone-related genes implies a biological function of FOXF2 in regulating bone development and remodeling."}],"content":"[[Abstract]]"},{"id":"623d8034-abca-4c1c-9a50-f3a29be4b6f9","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-12bf-4d01-b0b7-1db504379947","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"![Wang et al_2019_Nature Communications_FOXF2 reprograms breast cancer cells into bone metastasis seeds.pdf](../assets/Wang_et_al_2019_Nature_Communications_FOXF2_reprograms_breast_cancer_cells_into_bone_metastasis_seeds_1647880058359_0.pdf)"}],"content":"[[Attachments]]"}]},{"id":"623d8033-5735-43e0-a828-54d234d88985","page-name":"2022-02-21","children":[{"id":"623d8033-e1bc-487b-a430-8823877640c5","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8033-9c6c-4eda-b85e-662fdd73c1cc","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"I'm grateful for the "}],"content":"21st Feb"}]},{"id":"623d8032-1924-4af1-b233-43b762f8e200","page-name":"SP-2577","children":[{"id":"623d8032-c92f-4cb9-99eb-fb83ae85e5ab","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Clinical successor of SP-2509 (drug that blocking the interaction of ZNF217 and LSD1)"},{"id":"623d8032-1f96-40ea-9e1d-ad7f63a4eb62","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8032-a3a6-4729-b9ac-a0d2cabe817c","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"((61d560c3-adee-4ef0-8ba3-a1f3e5f67ab7))"}],"content":"SP-2577 Mechanism: disrupt epigenetic complexes that include LSD1"},{"id":"623d8032-1a77-47ca-b04f-37337a14c5ee","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8032-9ee7-46aa-81c0-05096ed419d8","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"((61d56258-aa62-4951-ace4-92b618ea89b5))"},{"id":"623d8032-2cb0-45e5-a687-ba51e6d620c5","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"((61d5627e-c75e-479b-99ff-bc63df915afe))"}],"content":"SP-2577 does not bind to catalytic domain"},{"id":"623d8032-accc-4d39-9d31-f20fbb364f5a","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8032-b11e-4b40-bbae-877e47101f85","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Abstract 1175: Identification of novel combination therapies with the LSD1 inhibitor SP-2577 (Seclidemstat) in Ewing's Sarcoma using a complete druggable CRISPR library approach"}],"content":"Use in combination to treat **Ewing's Sarcoma**"},{"id":"623d8032-cce5-4f74-8582-cc435c6740e0","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8032-57e8-4a77-8cb2-3740d765f0de","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"((61d59cf9-d7d7-4d71-8a99-df41a0257750))"}],"content":"NOT stable in water for 6 days at 37oC"},{"id":"623d8032-d10d-446b-85c7-17cfc41b536d","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":""}]},{"id":"623d8034-6cb1-444f-a4d3-555b650903fd","page-name":"2022-03-02","children":[{"id":"623d8034-c0cc-41cb-81eb-59a1284de583","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"07:43  Wake up today I had really good sleep the time of deep sleep is 2 1/2 hours"},{"id":"623d8034-e3bf-4723-9694-7055065ecfea","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"DONE Count the osteoclasts\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2022-03-02 Wed 10:11:53]--[2022-03-02 Wed 15:51:41] =>  05:39:48\n:END:"},{"id":"623d8034-9587-4a72-a16e-5f33f46855d7","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"13:21  Listen to gut micro biome podcast"},{"id":"623d8034-dcc1-4d55-a308-e4ff4e4dc27f","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Now I try the new dr ibble on the iPad there is something more that I need to get  familiar with.

The present study aimed to explore the expression levels of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP2) as determinants of RCC-associated bone metastasis. Their expression was evaluated in a newly generated RCC cell subline that has a high potential for bone metastasis, in tissue specimens from metastasized bone tissues from patients with RCC and in RCC tissues without metastasis. A total of 25 RCC tissue specimens without metastasis and 13 RCC tissue specimens with bone metastasis were acquired for immunohistochemical analysis of EZH2, MMP2 and TIMP2 protein expression. The expression levels of EZH2, MMP2 and TIMP2 mRNA and protein were analyzed in the ACHN and ACHN-BO5 cell lines using western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Methylation-specific PCR was also used to analyze TIMP2 promoter methylation. EZH2 and MMP2 proteins were found to be expressed at higher levels in tissues from patients where RCC had metastasized to the bone as compared with those in RCC patients without metastasis, whereas there was no significant difference in the expression of TIMP2 protein between the two tissues. Furthermore, the expression of EZH2 protein was correlated with MMP2 expression, but there was no significant correlation between the expression of EZH2 and TIMP2 proteins. The in vitro results using cell lines confirmed the ex vivo findings, indicating that the expression levels of EZH2 and MMP2 protein and mRNA were higher in ACHN-BO5 cells than those in ACHN cells. By contrast, TIMP2 protein and mRNA expression levels were lower in ACHN-BO5 cells than those in the parental ACHN cells. The TIMP2 promoter was highly methylated in ACHN-BO5 cells compared with that in ACHN cells. Upregulation of EZH2, MMP2 and TIMP2 expression was correlated with metastasis of RCC to bone tissues ex vivo and in vitro. Further studies are required in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the altered expression of these genes."}],"content":"[[Abstract]]"},{"id":"623d8034-5d4f-458d-814f-7b3ffb7b42cf","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8034-2238-484e-9cf1-20cc4464fe74","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"![Wang et al_2015_Molecular Medicine Reports_Alterations in enhancer of zeste homolog 2, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and.pdf](../assets/Wang_et_al_2015_Molecular_Medicine_Reports_Alterations_in_enhancer_of_zeste_homolog_2,_matrix_metalloproteinase-2_and_1647426552397_0.pdf)"}],"content":"[[Attachments]]"}]},{"id":"623d8033-32b5-4359-a9d4-4c7450d35f8a","page-name":"2022-02-16","children":[{"id":"623d8033-5cf3-4f72-878b-7e2597b24f17","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Morning\n"},{"id":"623d8033-6b10-4390-b3fd-482e00ae26cc","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Start with the treatment of MTS with PAC."},{"id":"623d8033-f9c4-460f-ac8f-186f4f7c144c","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Did the meeting with PC and Mallorie, we found that Chrysine works well with the 2F1 and 1C4"}]},{"id":"623d8033-4642-4ac4-8509-0c48e29fc55c","page-name":"2022-01-17","children":[{"id":"623d8033-eb45-4ec8-a106-7214ae446183","properties":{"collapsed":true},"format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8033-0926-4b72-b1c8-63a21d8535f4","format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"Grateful my girlfriend is here.

Mình thì nghèo, áo mưa đéo có tiền mua. Chịu nhục nhã như thế để mà phấn đấu đạt được thành tích cao, cuộc sống có ý nghĩa. Nếu không đạt được điều này thì mọi sự hi sinh trên còn có ý nghĩa gì chứ. Lúc đó coi như là lầm đường lạc lối.\n\nNhục nhất là bị bạn bè hàng xóm chê cười: thằng này nó học cho lắm cuối cùng cũng làm được cái gì đâu, thua thằng x thằng y nó kiếm được mấy tỉ xây cái nhà to đùng. ĐM nhục lắm.\n\nMột thằng loser như thế thì làm sao xây dựng nổi gia đình bây giờ, đầu tiên là không chọn được người tốt để lấy làm vợ. Những người tốt họ sẽ chọn những bộ gen ưu tú hơn để duy trì, việc không được lựa chọn thì cũng là lẽ thường tình thôi. Thứ hai là tiền không đủ, danh tiếng không có, mối quan hệ không, làm sao có thể duy trì gia đình được.\n\nLười biếng không triệt tiêu được thói trì hoãn, làm việc không theo kế hoạch. Những thứ này sẽ giết chết mình đầu tiên. Nên nhớ là khi tài năng đến thì mọi người sẽ tự muốn kết giao với bạn (như mình gần đây là minh chứng, mới chỉ 7 IELTS thôi đó). Tài năng không có, lười biếng thì những người giỏi họ sẽ né như nhé hủi thôi."},{"id":"623d8032-6a5a-447a-980c-3cfe58a9e53f","format":"markdown","children":[{"id":"623d8032-a110-401f-b1f8-ef3a4b93fa73","properties":{"collapsed":true},"format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"My Main Goal\ncollapsed:: true\n------------"},{"id":"623d8032-79be-49e5-b349-352f5be9c3ce","properties":{"collapsed":true},"heading-level":3,"format":"markdown","children":[],"content":"### Successful scientist and ideal father\ncollapsed:: true\n\nAiming for become a successful scientist who get PhD in France.

Nói chung là đạt được bất cứ thành tựu gì là phải khoe ra, thậm chí nói quá lên một chút, như bố cái Khanh vẫn làm vậy. Điều này là vô cùng cần thiết. Phương án 2 là tiết kiệm tiền bạc từ việc dạy thêm để trang trải cuộc sống học.\\\nNhưng việc đi làm thêm lại dẫn tới khó khăn mới là mệt mỏi và không đủ thời gian.
